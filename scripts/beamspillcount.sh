# Small subset of a script to run the optical library building job on the grid within larbatch infrastructure, modified by pkryczyn@fnal.gov
#
#
# To run this job:
#
# jobsub -X509_USER_PROXY /scratch/[user]/grid/[user].uboone.proxy -N [NoOfJobs] -q OpticalLibraryBuild_Grid.sh `whoami` `pwd`
#
# You will get outputs in the area specified by the "outstage" variable 
# which is specified below.
#
# The form of the output is one file for each few voxels. These then need 
# stitching together, which is done after all jobs are done, with a
# dedicated stitching script.
#

umask 0002
verbose=T

# Copy arguments into meaningful names.

process=${PROCESS}









# And then tell the user about it:
echo "This job will run on spill $process "


echo "physics.producers.generator.EventSpillOffset: $process">> $FCL
